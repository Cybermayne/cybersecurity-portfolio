# About Me

**Name:** Kenneth Bishop  
**Hometown:** South Fulton, GA 

**Prior IT Experience:**  
  I have a background in telecommunications, where I worked in sales, troubleshooting, and eventually advanced to a managerial role. This experience allowed me to develop strong problem-solving skills, a solid understanding of network infrastructure, and the ability to lead and support teams effectively. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with hardware, having built my computer from scratch, which deepened my knowledge of system components and assembly.

**Career Plans:**  
  After completing the cybersecurity course, I aim to pursue a career in threat intelligence and penetration testing. I am particularly drawn to the proactive nature of these roles, where the focus is on identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating risks before they can be exploited. The idea of preventing cyberattacks before they happen excites me, because it combines technical expertise with strategic thinking to protect organizations from evolving threats. I am eager to develop skills in analyzing threat data, simulating real-world attacks, and implementing robust security measures to safeguard critical systems and data. Ultimately, I want to contribute to building a safer digital environment by staying one step ahead of cybercriminals.

**Proud Project/Task:**  
  The project I am most proud of is launching my urban farm last year. What began as a simple effort to grow fresh vegetables for my family quickly evolved into the foundation of a small produce business. This endeavor holds a special place in my heart because it marked one of the first times my family came together in a multigenerational effort, united by a shared goal. Witnessing the potential of what we’ve started has filled us with excitement, and we now eagerly anticipate each new growing season.

# Day in Review - 2025-03-06

## Overview
Today's session focused on the concept of becoming **indistractable**—learning how to control our attention and prioritize what truly matters. We explored the root causes of distraction, practiced mindfulness, and discussed strategies for managing time and energy effectively.

---

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. **Understanding Distraction**
   - The word **distraction** was deconstructed into its root: **dis-traction**, meaning a loss of traction toward your goals.
   - The opposite of distraction is not focus but **traction**—actions that align with your values and long-term objectives.
   - We often prioritize the **urgent** at the expense of what is truly **important**.

### 2. **Mindfulness Exercise: Finding Amazement**
   - We did an exercise to find something to be amazed by for **30 seconds**.
   - I chose a **pencil** and noticed:
     - The **embossed and debossed text** on its surface.
     - The **brass ferrule** and **soft eraser** at the top.
     - The intricate process required to apply the **gold foil**.
   - This exercise helped me appreciate the **nuance and thought** that goes into even the simplest objects.

### 3. **Root Cause of Distraction**
   - Most external stimuli are not the root cause of distraction.
   - Instead, distraction often stems from an **internal need to avoid discomfort or pain**.
   - Recognizing this allows us to address the underlying issues rather than blaming external factors.

### 4. **Proactive Scheduling**
   - **Proper scheduling** is key to managing distractions.
   - Use a calendar to **turn your values into time**—allocate time for what truly matters.
   - Managing **energy** is just as important as managing time.

### 5. **Strategies for Becoming Indistractable**
   - **Prioritize traction**: Focus on actions that align with your goals.
   - **Schedule intentionally**: Block time for important tasks and stick to your plan.
   - **Manage discomfort**: Identify and address the internal triggers that lead to distraction.
   - **Practice mindfulness**: Regularly pause to appreciate the present moment and refocus your attention.

## Reflection
Today's session was a powerful reminder of the importance of **intentionality** in how we spend our time and energy. By understanding the root causes of distraction and prioritizing traction, I feel better equipped to stay focused on my goals. The mindfulness exercise with the pencil was a humbling experience—it showed me how much detail and effort goes into even the simplest objects, reinforcing the value of paying attention to the present moment. I am committed to using proactive scheduling and mindfulness practices to become **indistractable** and align my actions with my values.

## Next Steps
- Reflect on my values and **turn them into time** by scheduling intentional blocks in my calendar.

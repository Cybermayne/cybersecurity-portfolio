# Day in Review - 2025-03-17

## Overview
Today’s session began with setting up **CentOS**, a Linux distribution that behaves differently from Ubuntu. We then focused on **user management**, starting with **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** and moving on to **Linux user and group accounts**. We also explored cryptographic algorithms and their role in cybersecurity. It was a highly informative day that deepened my understanding of system administration and security.

---

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. **Setting Up CentOS**
   - We installed and configured **CentOS**, a Linux distribution known for its stability and use in enterprise environments.
   - Compared to **Ubuntu**, CentOS felt more streamlined for server use, with differences in package management and default configurations.

### 2. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
   - **IAM** ensures that the right individuals access the right resources at the right times for the right reasons.
   - The four pillars of IAM are:
     1. **Identity**: Who you are (e.g., a username like `john_doe`).
     2. **Authentication**: Proving your identity (e.g., entering a password or using a fingerprint).
     3. **Authorization**: What you’re allowed to do (e.g., granting `john_doe` access to a specific folder).
     4. **Accounting**: Tracking what you do (e.g., logging `john_doe`’s file access attempts).
   - Example: A user logs in with a username and password (authentication), accesses only their home directory (authorization), and their actions are logged for review (accounting).

### 3. **Linux User Management**
   - **User Accounts**:
     - **Standard Users**: Regular users with limited permissions (e.g., `john_doe`).
     - **System (Service) Users**: Used by the system to run services (e.g., `apache` for the Apache web server).
   - **Differences Between System and Standard Users**:
     | **System Users**                     | **Standard Users**                  |
     |-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
     | Created for system services.         | Created for human users.            |
     | No login shell (e.g., `/sbin/nologin`). | Has a login shell (e.g., `/bin/bash`). |
     | Typically has restricted permissions. | Permissions based on user role.     |

   - **Groups**:
     - **Primary Group**: The default group for a user. Each user has exactly one primary group.
     - **Secondary Groups**: Additional groups a user can belong to for extra permissions.
   - **Differences Between Primary and Secondary Groups**:
     | **Primary Group**                    | **Secondary Groups**                |
     |-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
     | Default group for a user.            | Additional groups for extra access. |
     | Only one primary group per user.     | A user can belong to multiple secondary groups. |
     | Files created by the user belong to this group. | Used for shared access to resources. |

   - **User Account Files**:
     - `/etc/passwd`: Stores user account information (e.g., username, UID, home directory).
     - `/etc/shadow`: Stores encrypted passwords and password-related settings.
     - `/etc/group`: Stores group information.

### 4. **Cryptographic Algorithms**
   - We discussed how cryptographic algorithms are used in cybersecurity to secure data.
   - Examples include:
     - **Hashing**: Converting data into a fixed-size string (e.g., SHA-256 for password storage).
     - **Encryption**: Transforming data to make it unreadable without a key (e.g., AES for file encryption).
   - These algorithms are essential for protecting sensitive information.

### 5. **Account Management Commands**
   | Command          | Description                                                                 | Example Usage                     |

# Day in Review - 2025-03-18

## Overview
Today’s session focused on **Linux user permissions**, a critical aspect of system security and file management. We explored file and directory **ownership**, **permissions**, and how to modify them using the `chmod` command. We also learned about **octal values** for representing permissions and briefly touched on **special permissions** like `SUID`, `GUID`, and the **sticky bit**. It was a highly technical and practical day that deepened my understanding of Linux file systems.

---

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. **File and Directory Ownership**
   - Every file and directory in Linux has **three types of owners**:
     1. **User (u)**: The owner of the file/directory (typically the user who created it).
     2. **Group (g)**: A group of users who share access to the file/directory.
     3. **Other (o)**: All other users who are not the owner or part of the group.
   - Ownership determines **who has control** over a file or directory.

### 2. **File and Directory Permissions**
   - Permissions define **what actions** can be performed on a file or directory.
   - There are **three types of permissions**:
     1. **Read (r)**:
        - For **files**: Allows viewing the file’s content.
        - For **directories**: Allows listing the directory’s contents.
     2. **Write (w)**:
        - For **files**: Allows modifying the file’s content.
        - For **directories**: Allows creating, deleting, or renaming files within the directory.
     3. **Execute (x)**:
        - For **files**: Allows running the file as a program or script.
        - For **directories**: Allows accessing files within the directory (e.g., using `cd`).

### 3. **Octal Values for Permissions**
   - Permissions can be represented using **octal values** (0–7), where each digit corresponds to a combination of `r`, `w`, and `x`:
     | Octal Value | Permission | Binary Representation |
     |-------------|------------|-----------------------|
     | **0**       | `---`      | 000                   |
     | **1**       | `--x`      | 001                   |
     | **2**       | `-w-`      | 010                   |
     | **3**       | `-wx`      | 011                   |
     | **4**       | `r--`      | 100                   |
     | **5**       | `r-x`      | 101                   |
     | **6**       | `rw-`      | 110                   |
     | **7**       | `rwx`      | 111                   |
   - Examples:
     - `755`: `rwxr-xr-x` (Owner has full access; group and others have read and execute access).
     - `644`: `rw-r--r--` (Owner has read and write access; group and others have read access).

### 4. **Changing Permissions with `chmod`**
   - The `chmod` command is used to change file and directory permissions.
   - Examples:
     - `chmod 755 file.txt`: Sets permissions to `rwxr-xr-x`.
     - `chmod u+w file.txt`: Adds write permission for the owner.
     - `chmod g-r file.txt`: Removes read permission for the group.

### 5. **Special Permissions**
   - **SUID (Set User ID)**: Allows a file to be executed with the permissions of the file’s owner.
     - Example: `chmod u+s file.txt`.
   - **GUID (Set Group ID)**: Allows a file to be executed with the permissions of the file’s group.
     - Example: `chmod g+s file.txt`.
   - **Sticky Bit**: Restricts file deletion in a directory to the file’s owner, the directory’s owner, or the root user.
     - Example: `chmod +t /shared_directory`.

    - Example: `dnf install package`

### 4. Other Notable Package Managers
- `pacman` (Arch Linux)
- `zypper` (openSUSE)
- `snap`/`flatpak` (cross-distribution)

## Process Management

### 1. Fundamental Concepts
- **PID (Process ID)**: Unique numerical identifier for each process
- **PPID (Parent Process ID)**: The PID of the process that created this process
- **Process Hierarchy**: All processes descend from init/systemd (PID 1)

### 2. Process States
| State | Description | Common Triggers |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Running** | Currently executing on CPU | Normal operation |
| **Sleeping** | Waiting for resource/event | I/O operations |
| **Stopped** | Suspended by signal | Ctrl+Z, `kill -STOP` |
| **Zombie** | Completed but not reaped | Parent hasn't read exit status |

### 3. Threads and Processing
- **Thread**: Lightweight process sharing memory space
- **Multi-core**: True parallel execution across CPU cores
- **Hyperthreading**: Single core appearing as multiple logical processors

### 4. Key Process Commands
| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `ps` | Display processes | `ps aux` |
| `top` | Interactive process viewer | `top` |
| `htop` | Enhanced process viewer | `htop` |
| `kill` | Send signals to processes | `kill -9 PID` |
| `nice` | Adjust process priority | `nice -n 10 command` |
| `pgrep` | Find processes by name | `pgrep firefox` |

## Reflection
Today's deep dive into package management clarified why Linux distributions handle software differently than Windows. Understanding the Debian/Red Hat split and their respective tools will be crucial for system administration. The process management section was particularly fascinating as it revealed how Linux handles multitasking at a fundamental level.

| **Executables**    | `exec()` system call     | Binary program execution         | `/usr/bin/firefox`        |
| **Scripts**        | Shebang interpretation   | Interpreted language execution   | `./script.sh`             |
| **Service Files**  | `systemd` unit files     | Daemon processes                 | `/etc/systemd/system/nginx.service` |
| **Socket Files**   | Inetd/xinetd             | On-demand network services       | `/run/sshd.socket`        |

### 2. Threading Architecture

#### Thread Types
| Model              | Implementation          | Characteristics                  | Best For                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **User-Level**     | pthread library         | Fast but non-preemptive          | CPU-bound tasks            |
| **Kernel-Level**   | `clone()` syscall       | OS-managed, preemptive           | I/O-bound tasks            |
| **Hybrid**         | NPTL (Native POSIX)     | Combines both advantages         | Modern applications        |

#### Thread Management
```c
// Thread creation example
pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, thread_function, NULL);

// Mutex synchronization
pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
// Critical section
pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

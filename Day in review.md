# Day in Review - 2025-03-06

## Overview
Today's session focused on the concept of becoming **indistractable**—learning how to control our attention and prioritize what truly matters. We explored the root causes of distraction, practiced mindfulness, and discussed strategies for managing time and energy effectively.

---

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. **Understanding Distraction**
   - The word **distraction** was deconstructed into its root: **dis-traction**, meaning a loss of traction toward your goals.
   - The opposite of distraction is not focus but **traction**—actions that align with your values and long-term objectives.
   - We often prioritize the **urgent** at the expense of what is truly **important**.

### 2. **Mindfulness Exercise: Finding Amazement**
   - We did an exercise to find something to be amazed by for **30 seconds**.
   - I chose a **pencil** and noticed:
     - The **embossed and debossed text** on its surface.
     - The **brass ferrule** and **soft eraser** at the top.
     - The intricate process required to apply the **gold foil**.
   - This exercise helped me appreciate the **nuance and thought** that goes into even the simplest objects.

### 3. **Root Cause of Distraction**
   - Most external stimuli are not the root cause of distraction.
   - Instead, distraction often stems from an **internal need to avoid discomfort or pain**.
   - Recognizing this allows us to address the underlying issues rather than blaming external factors.

### 4. **Proactive Scheduling**
   - **Proper scheduling** is key to managing distractions.
   - Use a calendar to **turn your values into time**—allocate time for what truly matters.
   - Managing **energy** is just as important as managing time.

### 5. **Strategies for Becoming Indistractable**
   - **Prioritize traction**: Focus on actions that align with your goals.
   - **Schedule intentionally**: Block time for important tasks and stick to your plan.
   - **Manage discomfort**: Identify and address the internal triggers that lead to distraction.
   - **Practice mindfulness**: Regularly pause to appreciate the present moment and refocus your attention.

## Reflection
Today's session was a powerful reminder of the importance of **intentionality** in how we spend our time and energy. By understanding the root causes of distraction and prioritizing traction, I feel better equipped to stay focused on my goals. The mindfulness exercise with the pencil was a humbling experience—it showed me how much detail and effort goes into even the simplest objects, reinforcing the value of paying attention to the present moment. I am committed to using proactive scheduling and mindfulness practices to become **indistractable** and align my actions with my values.

# Day in Review - 2025-03-10

## Overview
Today marked the first day of actual coursework in the program. We delved into the **components of a computer**, explored the differences between **BIOS and UEFI**, and discussed the evolution of hardware technology. The session was both enlightening and humbling, as it revealed how much there is to learn about even the most basic aspects of computing.

---

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. **Computer Components**
   - We reviewed the key components of a computer and how they work together:
     - **Motherboard**: The central hub that connects all hardware components.
     - **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Temporary storage for active processes and data.
     - **Storage Devices**: Including HDDs (Hard Disk Drives), SSDs (Solid State Drives), and NVMe drives.
   - I realized that while I thought I knew a lot about computer basics, there is still much more to learn.

### 2. **BIOS vs. UEFI**
   - We covered the differences between **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)** and **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)**:
     - BIOS is older and has limitations, such as slower boot times and support for only 16-bit processes.
     - UEFI is modern, faster, and supports 32-bit and 64-bit processes, as well as larger storage drives.
   - This was my first time understanding the distinction between the two.

### 3. **32-bit vs. 64-bit**
   - We discussed the differences between **32-bit** and **64-bit** systems:
     - **32-bit systems** can only address up to 4 GB of RAM.
     - **64-bit systems** can handle significantly more RAM and are more efficient for modern applications.
   - This was a new concept for me, and it helped clarify why 64-bit systems are the standard today.

### 4. **Obsolete Hardware and Replacements**
   - We touched on obsolete hardware and their modern replacements:
     - For example, **BIOS** has largely been replaced by **UEFI**.
   - Understanding the evolution of hardware technology provided context for how current systems are designed.

### 5. **Theoretical Hardware Issues**
   - We explored theoretical scenarios involving hardware issues, such as:
     - Diagnosing a failing hard drive.
     - Troubleshooting RAM-related problems.
   - These exercises highlighted the importance of understanding how components interact.

## Reflection
Today's session was a deep dive into the **fundamentals of computer hardware**, and it was both fascinating and humbling. I realized that while I had some prior knowledge, there is still so much to learn about how computers work at a fundamental level. The discussion on **BIOS vs. UEFI** and **32-bit vs. 64-bit** systems was particularly enlightening, as it clarified concepts I had never fully understood. I also appreciated the historical context provided by discussing obsolete hardware and its modern replacements. My main takeaway was how **deep down the rabbit hole** you can go for every single component in a computer, and how understanding these details can shape the way we approach technology today.

---

## Next Steps
- Review the material on **BIOS vs. UEFI** and **32-bit vs. 64-bit** systems to solidify my understanding.
- Research additional resources on computer hardware to deepen my knowledge.
